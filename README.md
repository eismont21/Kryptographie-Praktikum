# Kryptographie & Datensicherheit Praktikum

## Overview
This repository features a series of cryptographic algorithms and exercises developed during [an internship at KIT](https://crypto.kastel.kit.edu/courses_praktikum_kryptographie_und_datensicherheit.php). It provides practical insights into various cryptographic methods and their applications.

## Content
The repository is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific cryptographic concept:

- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Implementation of the classic Diffie-Hellman algorithm for secure key exchange. This section demonstrates the establishment of a shared secret between parties in a cryptographic communication.
- **RSA Padding**: Focuses on padding schemes in RSA encryption, highlighting the importance of secure padding in preventing vulnerabilities such as oracle attacks.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Exploration of ECC, particularly focusing on invalid curves. This section delves into the subtleties of ECC and the significance of curve selection in ensuring cryptographic strength.
- **Permutation Cryptanalysis**: Practical exercises in analyzing and attacking permutation-based encryption schemes. This segment covers the methods for deciphering or compromising encryption that relies on permutation.
- **PIN Security**: Examining the security aspects of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) in the context of EC cards, emphasizing techniques to enhance PIN security.
- **Small Exponent Attack**: Handling and mitigating small exponent attacks in cryptographic systems. This part explores the vulnerabilities associated with small exponents in RSA and methods to counteract them.
- **Signature and Hashing**: Implementations of various digital signature and hashing algorithms. It highlights the role of these techniques in ensuring data integrity and authentication in cryptographic systems.
